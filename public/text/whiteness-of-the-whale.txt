Or is it, that as in essence whiteness
is not so much a color as the visible absence of color;
and at the same time the concrete of all colors;
...there is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning,in a wide landscape of snows
-a colorless, all-color of atheism from which we shrink?
And when we consider...that all other earthly hues
-every stately or lovely emblazoning-
the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods;
...the gilded velvets of butterflies,
and the butterfly cheeks of young girls;
all these are but subtile deceits
...only laid on from without;
...and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues,
the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself,
and if operating without medium...would touch...with its own blank [hue]-
pondering all this, the palsied universe
lies before us a leper;
...[even tulips and roses]...
and like wilful travellers in Lapland,
who refuse to wear colored and coloring glasses upon their eyes,
so the...infidel gazes himself blind
at the monumental white shroud
that wraps all the prospect
around him.
